Our design is the "timeline" of patient symptoms relative to the date of their
1st TBI. The tasks we hoped to achieve with this visualization were to compare
frequencies of symptoms before and after the TBI, possibly detecting trends in
the symptoms, and also to compare symptoms by age of the patient. The visualization
aligns patients' TBI encounters in the middle of the visualization, highlighting
symptoms at encounters on each patients' timeline on the x-axis. The symptoms
have their own unique indicator, so this allows the user to get an idea or even
count the frequency of symptoms. The second task is achieved with age group color
coding for each patient's timeline.

We expect that the entire visualization could be viewed on a 24-inch monitor in
order to get an overview of the data presented. Since there are ~40 patients and
symptoms are fairly rare, this seems feasible. We planned for the visualization
to have interaction to filter by symptom or age group to obtain more detailed
information, and temporal changes should be easily recognized on a timeline.

Compared to some other designs such as the percentage graphs, this visualization
could be cluttered with every symptom represented by its own glyph. However, not
every encounter has a symptom present, and it is usually one symptom per encounter,
so I expect it would remain readable. If the glyphs and color are used well in
this visualization I think it would also be visually pleasing.
