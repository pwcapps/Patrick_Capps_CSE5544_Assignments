When using all of the data points (bigplot), the vector field is extremely dense and little
information can be gained, except that magnitudes are large in the center and
bottom corner.

Sampling the data (smallplot) allows the plot to clearly show magnitudes of the vectors.
Magnitudes are near zero in a curve from the region of (0.5, 1) to the region of
(0, 1) and the flow in the surrounding area is away from this curve and gets stronger
further away. We can also see another zero point near (0.7, -0.5).

By taking more samples (mediumplot), the vector field starts to look like columns, where flow
is strong in one direction at some point in the column, but reverse direction as
you move along the column.

Increasing the vector size (largevecs) gives an exaggerated view of the flow in
the vector field. The vectors curve more strongly since there is more interpolation,
and overlap somewhat to give a clear idea of overall direction. Smaller vectors
(smallvecs) make it easier to see near zero points since the vectors essentially
become points with a smaller scale.

Since the data in this case is very dense, I think the highly sampled plot with
increased vector size makes it easiest to see the features of the data, since it
is not cluttered with too many points, and the large curving vectors clearly show
flow. Using all of the data is too hard to read, and using twice as many points
does not reveal much more information. I also find that decreasing vector scale
makes it difficult to see the overall pattern.
